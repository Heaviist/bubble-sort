# bubble-sort
The Odin Project´s Bubble Sort project in ruby

# Assignment
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.

# Goal
It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn’t it?).

# Expectations
- Tricky part might be how to take the two values and switch them without messing up the array. Probably slice, rotate, insert
- An other thing that seems interesting is how to make sure you're done. Probably gotta keep a tracking value.

# Results and Evaluation
To be added later.
